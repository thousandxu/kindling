## Sign your commits

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for a commit. All commits need to be signed. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to contribute the material. The rules are pretty simple, if you can certify the rules (from [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/)), then you just need to add a line to every git commit message, like:

```
Signed-off-by: lina <lina@example.cn>
```

### Configure auto commit signing in git 

1. Set your `user.name` and `user.email` using the following commands:

   ```
   git config --global user.name lina
   
   git config --global user.email lina@example.cn
   ```

2. Sign your commit with `git commit -s`, then use `git log` to verify that the signed-off message is added.

   ```
   Author: lina <lina@example.cn>
   
   Date:  Tue Jan 25 09:42:40 2022 +0800
   
     add content
   
     Signed-off-by: lina <lina@example.cn>
   ```
